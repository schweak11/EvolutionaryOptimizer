# EvolutionaryOptimizer
A simple, robust optimization algorithm to solve multivariate equations or optimize many parameters

The optimizer starts with random parameters and randomly changes these to slowly minimize/maximize the specified function. If a random change makes the new function worse, it is discarded, otherwise, it is kept.
